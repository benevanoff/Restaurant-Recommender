## Project Summary
Our project aims at building a web application that makes the decision on where to eat for people. The data we store are restaurants’ information, users’ profiles, and their history and preferences for restaurant selection.

Essentially, all the user has to do is to click the button and the restaurant generator will give one recommendation in the vicinity based on the user’s and others’ dining history. The user can also manually add preferences or search criteria each time to narrow recommendation or add tags to their profile if they would like to be recommended based on the choices of other people who share the same tags.
